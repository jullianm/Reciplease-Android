# Reciplease - ANDROID version (Kotlin)

This is my first app as an Android developer. All written in Kotlin language (which I learned on raywenderlich.com).

**What is Reciplease?**

Reciplease is a recipes app that aims at helping the user find a list of recipes according to a list of ingredients.

**How does it work?**

- Recipes will be fetched accordingly and displayed in a list
- User will be able to see the recipe details when selecting one
- Recipe can be saved to favorites hitting the top-right star button

- Room - to handle local storage for recipes
- Picasso - to handle images

**APIs**

- Yummly API (will cease operation in September 30, 2019)
